# HelixDB Overview

HelixDB is a graph-vector database designed for modern applications that require complex relationship modeling and traversal. It combines the power of graph data structures for explicit relationships with vector embeddings for semantic search.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for fast traversals and insertions
- **Native Graph Storage**: Purpose-built storage engine optimized for graph operations
- **Native Vector Storage**: Purpose-built storage engine optimized for vector operations
- **Type Safety**: Explicit type definitions to ensure data integrity
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simple setup and intuitive APIs

## Architecture

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Graph Layer">
    Efficiently stores nodes, edges, and their properties using a specialized graph storage format that optimizes for both read and write operations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Vector Layer">
    Provides vector embeddings for semantic search and similarity queries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Query Engine">
    Compiles HQL code directly into the database engine, allowing for lighning fast queries.

## Data Model

HelixDB follows the property graph model, which consists of:

- **Nodes**: Represent entities with unique identifiers and properties
- **Vectors**: Represent entities with unique identifiers and vector embeddings
- **Edges**: Represent relationships between nodes and/or vectors, with directionality and properties
- **Properties**: Key-value pairs attached to both nodes, vectors and edges
- **Labels**: Categorize nodes and edges by type

This model allows for rich representation of complex domains while maintaining query performance.
