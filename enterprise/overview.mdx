# Overview


### What is Helix Hyperscale?

Helix Hyperscale is a new state of the art graph database, designed to be performant and robust at infinite scale. 
We have employed novel techniques and a new vector index architecture, based on cutting edge research, to operate an unsharded graph-vector hybrid database across 100s TBs of graph and vector data stored in Object Storage.

All Hyperscale cluster nodes are completely stateless and can be scaled horizontally and vertically as needed. 
We also provide full ACID compliance with the option to reduce consistency (eventual consistency) for higher throughput and lower latency.


### Features
- Horizontal and vertical scaling
- The ability to store in S3 compatible object layer
- Encryption at rest
- Backups and point in time recovery
- Multiple concurrent write requests (only 1 writer node though)
- Dashboard with monitoring, enterprise features and data visualization
- RBAC
