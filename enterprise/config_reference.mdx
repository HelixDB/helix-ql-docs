# Cluster Configuration Options

<Warning>
    This node count configuration settings do not apply to development clusters as they are limited to 1 gateway and 1 database node.
</Warning>

<ResponseField name="Minimum Gateway Nodes" type="number" default={3}>
    This is the minimum number of gateway nodes that can be deployed. Note that the minimum number of gateway nodes is 3
    ![Minimum Gateway Nodes](../images/dashboard.png)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Maximum Gateway Nodes" type="number" default={5}>
    This is the maximum number of gateway nodes that can be deployed. 
    ![Maximum Gateway Nodes](../images/dashboard.png)
    Note that the maximum number of gateway nodes is 100. If your usecase requires more please contact us.
</ResponseField>


<ResponseField name="Minimum Database Nodes" type="number" default={3}>
    This is the minimum number of database nodes that can be deployed.
    ![Minimum Database Nodes](../images/dashboard.png)
    Note that the minimum number of database nodes is 3.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Maximum Database Nodes" type="number" default={5}>
    This is the maximum number of database nodes that can be deployed.

<ResponseField name="Flush Interval" type="milliseconds" default={200}>
  Controls how often data is flushed from memory (memtable) to disk as SST files.                                                                                                 
                                                                 
  - Lower values: Better durability (less data loss on crash), but increased disk I/O
  - Higher values: Better write throughput, but more data at risk in memory
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="L0 SST Size" type="bytes" default={1024 * 1024 * 1024}>
  Target size for SST files created at Level 0 during flush operations.

  - Larger values: Fewer files created, reduced compaction overhead, but longer individual flush times
  - Smaller values: More granular files, faster flushes, but more compaction work
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Poll Interval" type="milliseconds" default={50}>
  How frequently the system checks for new data or events.

  - Lower values: More responsive to changes, but higher CPU usage
  - Higher values: Reduced CPU overhead, but increased latency for detecting changes
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="L0 Max SSTs Default" type="number" default={100}>
  Maximum number of SST files allowed at Level 0 before compaction is triggered.

  - Higher values: Better sustained write throughput, but slower read performance (more files to search)
  - Lower values: Faster reads, but more frequent compaction and write amplification
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="L0 Max SSTs Vector" type="number" default={100}>
  Maximum L0 SST files for the vector index (separate from graph data).

  - Higher values: Better vector ingestion throughput during bulk loads
  - Lower values: Faster vector similarity searches, but more compaction during writes
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Vector Block Cache Size" type="bytes" default={1024 * 1024 * 1024}>
  Memory allocated for caching frequently accessed vectors.

  - Higher values: Faster vector queries (more cache hits), reduced disk I/O
  - Lower values: Lower memory footprint, but slower queries due to more disk reads

  ⚠️ Over-allocating can cause memory pressure on the system.
