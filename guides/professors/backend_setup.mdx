---

This section will cover the Python code to connect to HelixDB and create nodes and edges, create embeddings for the professors, search by embeddings, and filtering.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install helix-py sentence-transformers
```
```bash uv
uv venv
uv add helix-py sentence-transformers
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 2: Imports and Setup for HelixDB
```python
import helix
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer("Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B")
db = helix.Client(local=True, port=6969, verbose=True)
```

## Step 3: Creating the nodes that we will link professors to

Here we start creating all the nodes that we will link a professors to.

**NOTE:** You can also make a query in helixdb to get the ID of the research area if you have the name, but we will store it in Python for simplicity.

We will be using `db.query("query_name", {"param": value})` to create the nodes and edges

```Python
research_areas = {
    "Computer Vision for Basketball": "Designing CNN and Transformer architectures that track player pose, ball trajectory, and court zones to quantify defensive pressure and shooting mechanics.",
    "Predictive Modelling & Simulation": "Building Monte-Carlo and sequence models that forecast possession outcomes and season performance using play-by-play and spatial data.",
    "Sports Analytics with Large Language Models": "Leveraging LLMs to explain model outputs, auto-generate commentary, and mine historical game archives for strategic patterns.",
    "Wearable Sensor Data Mining": "Applying time-series and graph learning techniques to inertial-measurement signals for fatigue monitoring and injury prevention.",
    "Fairness & Ethics in Sports AI": "Studying algorithmic bias and ensuring equitable analytics across different leagues, genders, and play styles."
}

research_area_ids = {}
for research_area in research_areas:
    research_area_node = db.query("create_research_area", {"area": research_area})
    research_area_ids[research_area] = research_area_node[0]['research_area']['id']

departments = ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Physics", "Chemistry", "Biology"]
department_ids = {}
for department in departments:
    department_node = db.query("create_department", {"name": department})
    department_ids[department] = department_node[0]['department']['id']

universities = ["Uni X", "Uni Y", "Uni Z"]
university_ids = {}
for university in universities:
    university_node = db.query("create_university", {"name": university})
    university_ids[university] = university_node[0]['university']['id']

labs = {"Basketball Data Science Lab": "An interdisciplinary group combining data science, biomechanics, and sport psychology to create next-generation analytics tools for basketball."}
lab_ids = {}
for lab in labs:
    lab_node = db.query("create_lab", {"name": lab, "research_focus": labs[lab]})
    lab_ids[lab] = lab_node[0]['lab']['id']
```

## Step 4: Linking professors to the nodes

We will use Qwen3 Embedding 0.6B as an example to create embeddings for the professors.

```Python
for professor in professors:
    # Create Professor Node
    professor_node =db.query("create_professor", {"name": professor["name"], "title": professor["title"], "page": professor["page"], "bio": professor["bio"]})

    professor_id = professor_node[0]['professor']['id']

    # Link Professor to Research Area
    for research_area in professor["key_research_areas"]:
        if research_area['area'] in research_areas:
            research_area_id = research_area_ids[research_area['area']]
            db.query("link_professor_to_research_area", {"professor_id": professor_id, "research_area_id": research_area_id})

    # Link Professor to Department
    for department in professor["department"]:
        if department in department_ids:
            department_id = department_ids[department]
            db.query("link_professor_to_department", {"professor_id": professor_id, "department_id": department_id})

    # Link Professor to University
    for university in professor["university"]:
        if university in university_ids:
            university_id = university_ids[university]
            db.query("link_professor_to_university", {"professor_id": professor_id, "university_id": university_id})

    # Link Professor to Lab
    for lab in professor["labs"]:
        if lab['name'] in lab_ids:
            lab_id = lab_ids[lab['name']]
            db.query("link_professor_to_lab", {"professor_id": professor_id, "lab_id": lab_id})

    # Create Research Area Embedding
    research_area_and_description = "\n".join([research_area['area'] + ": " + research_area['description'] for research_area in professor['key_research_areas']])
    research_area_and_description_embedding = model.encode(research_area_and_description).astype(float).tolist()
    db.query("create_research_area_embedding", {"professor_id": professor_id, "areas_and_descriptions": research_area_and_description, "vector": research_area_and_description_embedding})
```

We've now added all the nodes and edges to the graph, and created the embeddings for the professors. We can now search for similar professors based on their research area and description embeddings.

## Step 5: Searching for similar professors

```python
query = "Find me a professor who does computer vision for basketball"
embedded_query_vector = model.encode(query).astype(float).tolist()
    
results = db.query("search_similar_professors_by_research_area_and_description", 
{"query_vector": embedded_query_vector, "k": 5})

print(results)
```

<Accordion title="Python Print Result">
```python
[{'professors': [{'page': 'https://www.example.com',
 'label': 'Professor', 'bio': 'James is an Assistant Professor whose work sits at the intersection of basketball analytics, computer vision, and large-scale machine learning.  His research focuses on turning raw player-tracking video, wearable-sensor streams, and play-by-play logs into actionable insights for teams, coaches, and broadcasters. Signature projects include ShotNet— a deep learning model that predicts shot success probability in real time— and DunkGPT, a language model fine-tuned on millions of play descriptions to generate advanced scouting reports.',
 'name': 'James', 
 'id': '...', 
 'title': 'Assistant Professor'}]}]
```
</Accordion>

## Step 6: Example of getting the combined research area and description

```python
prof_research_areas_and_descriptions = db.query("get_professor_research_areas_with_descriptions", {"professor_id": results[0]['professors'][0]['id']})
print(prof_research_areas_and_descriptions)
```

<Accordion title="Python Print Result">
```text

## Step 7: Lets answer some of the questions we asked in the beginning

```

```rust query.hx
