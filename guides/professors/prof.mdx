## Introduction

We want to create a Python script that uses HelixDB to help students find professors based on their research areas and bio. For example a user could ask 
- "What professors does High-Energy Physics research?"
- "What professors are working in the X University?"
- "What professors are working in the Computer Science department?"
- "What professors are working in the X University and are working in the Computer Science department?"
- "I like doing research in Large Language Models, can you recommend me some professors doing this in X University?"

## The dataset

In this example, we have a dataset on Professors with fields like:
- Name
- Title
- Department(s)
- University
- Their page URL
- Short biography
- Key Research Areas and their descriptions
- Lab(s), the name, lab's research focus

We will be ingesting this data from a JSON file, an example is shown below:

```json
{
    "name": "James",
    "title": "Assistant Professor",
    "page": "https://james.com",
    "department": ["Computer Science"],
    "university": ["Uni X"],
    "bio": "James is an Assistant Professor whose work sits at the intersection
     of basketball analytics, computer vision, and large-scale machine learning. 
     His research focuses on turning raw player-tracking video, wearable-sensor streams,
     and play-by-play logs into actionable insights for teams, coaches, and broadcasters. 
     Signature projects include ShotNet— a deep learning model that predicts shot success
     probability in real time— and DunkGPT, a language model fine-tuned on millions of play descriptions
     to generate advanced scouting reports.",
    "key_research_areas": [
        {
            "area": "Computer Vision for Basketball",
            "description": "Designing CNN and Transformer architectures that track
             player pose, ball trajectory, and court zones to quantify defensive pressure and shooting mechanics."
        },
        {
            "area": "Predictive Modelling & Simulation",
            "description": "Building Monte-Carlo and sequence models that forecast 
            possession outcomes and season performance using play-by-play and spatial data." 
        },
        {
            "area": "Sports Analytics with Large Language Models",
            "description": "Leveraging LLMs to explain model outputs, auto-generate commentary,
             and mine historical game archives for strategic patterns." 
        },
        {
            "area": "Wearable Sensor Data Mining",
            "description": "Applying time-series and graph learning techniques to
             inertial-measurement signals for fatigue monitoring and injury prevention." 
        },
        {
            "area": "Fairness & Ethics in Sports AI",
            "description": "Studying algorithmic bias and ensuring equitable analytics across different leagues,
             genders, and play styles." 
        }
    ],
    "labs": [
        {
            "name": "Basketball Data Science Lab",
            "research_focus": "An interdisciplinary group combining data science, biomechanics, 
            and sport psychology to create next-generation analytics tools for basketball.",
        }
    ]
}
```

## Building a Graph

Based on this data, we can create a Vector Graph RAG with the following nodes and edges:

**Nodes:**

- Professor Node with properties `name`, `title`, `page`, `bio`
- Research Area Node with properties `area` and `description`
- Department Node with the property `name`
- University Node with the property `name`
- Lab Node with properties `name`, `research_focus`

**Vector Nodes for Embeddings:**

We will have an embedding of the professors's combined string on their research areas and research description.

- Professor Combined Research Area and Description Node with the property `areas_and_descriptions`

**Edges:**

- Professor to Research Area Edge
- Professor to Department Edge
- Professor to University Edge
- Professor to Lab Edge
- Professor to Professor Combined Research Area and Description Embedding


## Why do we need a Vector Graph RAG?

Let's imagine it on a larger scale where we have a lot of data on professors, 
research areas, departments, academic achievements, and labs across 1000+ universities. We can utilize a **graph** to 
connect these nodes and edges to each other so that we can traverse the graph faster to find all professors that are 
working in a specific university, department, research area, or lab e.g  we can filter the graph to find all professors that are working in the University X using `FILTER` in HelixQL. And we can utilize the **vector embeddings** to find professors that are most similar to a given query e.g *"Which professors have worked in a startup before?"*.
