## Step 1: HelixDB Setup

1. Create a folder for the project
2. Initialise HelixDB

```bash
mkdir professor_example
cd professor_example
helix init
```

## Step 2: Building our Graph Schema

As a reminder heres the graph we are going to build:

**Nodes:**

- Professor Node with properties `name`, `title`, `page`, `bio`
- Research Area Node with properties `area` and `description`
- Department Node with the property `name`
- University Node with the property `name`
- Academic Node with properties `degree`, `field`, `institution`, `year`
- Lab Node with properties `name`, `research_focus`, `links`

**Vector Nodes for Embeddings:**

For this app we will do an embedding of the professors's combined string on their research areas and research description.

- Professor Research Area + Description Node with the property `areas_and_descriptions`

**Edges:**

- Professor to Research Area Edge
- Professor to Department Edge
- Professor to University Edge
- Professor to Academic Edge
- Professor to Lab Edge
- Professor to Professor Research Area Embedding

**schema.hx:**

```rust
// NODES //

N::Professor {
    name: String,
    title: String,
    page: String,
    bio: String,
}

N::ResearchArea {
    research_area: String,
    description: String,
}

N::Department {
    name: String,
}   

N::University {
    name: String,
}

N::Lab {
    name: String,
    research_focus: String,
}


// Connect Professor to Lab
E::HasLab {
    From: Professor,
    To: Lab,
}

// Connect Professor to Research Area
E::HasResearchArea {
    From: Professor,
    To: ResearchArea,
}

// EDGES //

// Connect Professor to University
E::HasUniversity {
    From: Professor,
    To: University,
    Properties: {
        since: Date DEFAULT NOW,
    }
}

// Connect Professor to Department
E::HasDepartment {
    From: Professor,
    To: Department,
    Properties: {
        since: Date DEFAULT NOW,
    }
}

// VECTORS //

// Connect Professor to Research Area + Description
V::ResearchAreaAndDescriptionEmbedding {
    areas_and_descriptions: String,
}

E::HasResearchAreaAndDescriptionEmbedding {
    From: Professor,
    To: ResearchAreaAndDescriptionEmbedding,
    Properties: {
        areas_and_descriptions: String,
    }
}
```

Great! We've made the schema for our graph. Now lets think about the types of queries for ingesting our professors data.

## Step 3: Building our Queries

Lets build the queries to put our professor data based on the JSON and schema we have. There is many ways to do this, but for this
example I am keeping in mind that in my Python FastAPI backend, I will store the professor ID and make queries based on that ID.

**query.hx:**
```rust
// Create Professor Node
QUERY create_professor(name: String, title: String, page: String, bio: String ) =>
    professor <- AddN<Professor>({ name: name, title: title, page: page, bio: bio })
    RETURN professor

// Create Department Node
QUERY create_department(name: String) =>
    department <- AddN<Department>({ name: name })
    RETURN department

// Create University Node
QUERY create_university(name: String) =>
    university <- AddN<University>({ name: name })
    RETURN university

// Create Lab Node
QUERY create_lab(name: String, research_focus: String) =>
    lab <- AddN<Lab>({ name: name, research_focus: research_focus })
    RETURN lab

// Create Research Area Node
QUERY create_research_area(name: String) =>
    research_area <- AddN<ResearchArea>({ research_area: name })
    RETURN research_area
```

Now we need to link professors to other nodes:


```rust
// Link Professor to Department
QUERY link_professor_to_department(professor_id: ID, department_id: ID) =>
    professor <- N<Professor>(professor_id)
    department <- N<Department>(department_id)
    edge <- AddE<HasDepartment>::From(professor)::To(department)
    RETURN edge


// Link Professor to University
QUERY link_professor_to_university(professor_id: ID, university_id: ID) =>
    professor <- N<Professor>(professor_id)
    university <- N<University>(university_id)
    edge <- AddE<HasUniversity>::From(professor)::To(university)
    RETURN edge


// Link Professor to Lab
QUERY link_professor_to_lab(professor_id: ID, lab_id: ID) =>
    professor <- N<Professor>(professor_id)
    lab <- N<Lab>(lab_id)
    edge <- AddE<HasLab>::From(professor)::To(lab)
    RETURN edge

// Link Professor to Research Area
QUERY link_professor_to_research_area(professor_id: ID, research_area_id: ID) =>
    professor <- N<Professor>(professor_id)
    research_area <- N<ResearchArea>(research_area_id)
    edge <- AddE<HasResearchArea>::From(professor)::To(research_area)
    RETURN edge
```

Now let's create our embedding nodes, in this guide, we only will embed a combined string of all the professor's research area and description.

```rust
// Create Research Area Embedding Node
QUERY create_research_area_embedding(professor_id: ID, areas_and_descriptions: String, vector: [F64]) =>
    professor <- N<Professor>(professor_id)
    research_area <- AddV<ResearchAreaAndDescriptionEmbedding>(vector, { areas_and_descriptions: areas_and_descriptions })
    edge <- AddE<HasResearchAreaAndDescriptionEmbedding>::From(professor)::To(research_area)
    RETURN research_area
```

We need to be able to search for professors based on their embeddings. So we can use the `SearchV` operation to search for similar embeddings.

```rust
// Search Similar Professors based on Research Area + Description Embedding
QUERY search_similar_professors_by_research_area_and_description(query_vector: [F64], k: I64) =>
    vecs <- SearchV<ResearchAreaAndDescriptionEmbedding>(query_vector, k)
    professors <- vecs::In<HasResearchAreaAndDescriptionEmbedding>
    RETURN professors
```

Finally, we can get the actual string data of a professor's research area given professor ID. This will be
used after we search for similar professors based on their embeddings, then get the top k professors including
their ID and use that ID to get the actual string data of their research area.

```rust
// Get the actual string data of a professor's research area given professor ID
QUERY get_professor_research_areas_with_descriptions(professor_id: ID) =>
    research_areas <- N<Professor>(professor_id)::Out<HasResearchArea>
    RETURN research_areas

```

Awesome! We've built our graph schema and queries. Now how do we make a backend to connect to HelixDB?
