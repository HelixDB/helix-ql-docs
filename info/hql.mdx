Helix Query Language (HQL) is a specialized query language designed for HelixDB that enables powerful graph traversal and similarity search operations. It provides an intuitive way to explore and analyze connected data structures while incorporating advanced similarity search capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Graph Traversal**: Navigate through connected data points and relationships with ease
- **Similarity Search**: Perform semantic and vector-based similarity searches across your data
- **Flexible Query Structure**: Write expressive queries that combine both graph traversal and similarity search operations
- **Optimized Performance**: Built specifically for Helix's architecture to ensure efficient query execution

HQL makes it simple to express complex data relationships and find similar items in your dataset. Whether you're looking to traverse a knowledge graph, find semantically similar content, or combine both operations, HQL provides the tools you need to effectively query your data.
