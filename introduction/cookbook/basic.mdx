We're going to create a simple social network where users can follow each other and create posts.

---

### Step 1: Define the schema in schema.hx

We're going to define the schema for our social network in `schema.hx`.
We're going to have `User` nodes where users can `Follow` other users.
We're also going to have `Post` nodes where users can `Create` posts.

```rust [expandable]
N::User {
    name: String,
    age: U32,
    email: String,
    created_at: I32,
    updated_at: I32,
}

N::Post {
    content: String,
    created_at: I32,
    updated_at: I32,
}

E::Follows {
    From: User,
    To: User,
    Properties: {
        since: I32,
    }
}

E::Created {
    From: User,
    To: Post,
    Properties: {
        created_at: I32,
    }
}
```

---

### Step 2: Inserting data

Creating a user is done by inserting a new node into the graph.

```rust
QUERY CreateUser(name: String, age: U32, email: String, now: I32) =>
    user <- AddN<User>({name, age, email, created_at: now, updated_at: now})
    RETURN user
```

To let users follow another user, we need to create an edge between them.

```rust [expandable]
QUERY CreateFollow(follower_id: String, followed_id: String, now: I32) =>
    follower <- N<User>(follower_id)
    followed <- N<User>(followed_id)
    AddE<Follows>({since: now})::From(follower)::To(followed)
    RETURN "success"
```

To create a post, we need to create a post node and an edge between the user and the post.

```rust [expandable]
QUERY CreatePost(user_id: String, content: String, now: I32) =>
    user <- N<User>(user_id)
    post <- AddN<Post>({content, created_at: now, updated_at: now})
    AddE<Created>({created_at: now})::From(user)::To(post)
    RETURN post
```

---

### Step 3: Query the data

To get all users, we can use the following query:

```rust
QUERY GetUsers() =>
    users <- N<User>
    RETURN users
```

To get all posts, we can use the following query:

```rust
QUERY GetPosts() =>
    posts <- N<Post>
    RETURN posts
```

To get all posts by a user, we can use the following query:

```rust
QUERY GetPostsByUser(user_id: String) =>
    posts <- N<User>(user_id)::Out<Created>
    RETURN posts
```

To get all users that a user follows, we can use the following query:

```rust
QUERY GetFollowedUsers(user_id: String) =>
    followed <- N<User>(user_id)::Out<Follows>
    RETURN followed
```

As a more complex example,
we could have a query that loads an page containing the posts of users that a user follows.
To do this we are going to remap the posts to have a field containing information about the user that created the post.

```rust
QUERY GetFollowedUsersPosts(user_id: String) =>
    followers <- N<User>(user_id)::Out<Follows>
    posts <- followers::Out<Created>::RANGE(0, 40)
    RETURN posts::{
        post: content,
        creatorID: _::In<Created>::ID,
    }
```

<Accordion title="JSON output">
```json [expandable]
"posts": [
    {
        "post": "Hello, world!",
        "creatorID": "123"
    },
    {
        "post": "Hello, world!",
        "creatorID": "123"
    },
    ... // up to 40 posts
]
```
</Accordion>
