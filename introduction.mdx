## What is HelixDB?

HelixDB is a high-performance graph database designed for modern applications that require complex relationship modeling and traversal. It combines the power of graph data structures with efficient storage and query capabilities.

## What is Helix Query Language?

Helix Query Language (HQL) is the native query language for HelixDB. It provides a declarative way to define schemas, query data, and perform graph operations with an intuitive syntax designed specifically for graph traversals.
