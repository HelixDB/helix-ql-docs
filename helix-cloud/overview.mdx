## Overview

Each Helix Cloud cluster is a collection of **fully managed, secure** HelixDB instances.
Currently, users can only create a **single cluster** and there is only **one instance** in the cluster.

Each cluster is **logically isolated** from other clusters meaning your data is yours.
Each cluster is also **private** by default meaning it cannot be accessed from the internet apart from via the query endpoints you define.

All requests to the cluster are authenticated and authorized via an API key which is you are responsible for sending and managing securely (we handle the verification don't worry).

**Please reach out if you want to use Helix Cloud or have any questions.**
