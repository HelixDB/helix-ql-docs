## Graph Traversal Fundamentals

Graph traversal is the process of visiting vertices and edges in a graph. HQL provides a rich set of operations to navigate your graph data efficiently.

## Selection Operations

These operations serve as starting points for your graph traversals.

### Vertex Selection (`V`)

Select vertices from your graph to begin traversal.

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `V` | Select all vertices in the graph |
| `V<Type>` | Select all vertices of a specific type |
| `V("id")` | Select a vertex by its ID |
| `V<Type>("id1", "id2")` | Select vertices of a specific type with given IDs |

<Accordion title="Example: Vertex Selection">
```rust
QUERY GetUsers(userID: String) {
    // Select all vertices
    nodes <- V

    // Select all User vertices
    users <- V<Users>

    // Select a specific User by ID
    user <- V<User>(userID)

    // Select multiple Users by IDs
    other_users <- V<Users>(userID, "other_uuid")

    RETURN nodes, users, user, other_users
}
```
</Accordion>

### Edge Selection (`E`)

Select edges from your graph to begin traversal.

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `E` | Select all edges in the graph |
| `E<Type>` | Select all edges of a specific type |
| `E("id")` | Select an edge by its ID |
| `E<Type>("id1", "id2")` | Select edges of a specific type with given IDs |

<Accordion title="Example: Edge Selection">
```rust
QUERY GetFollowers(edgeID: String) {
    // Select all edges
    edges <- E

    // Select all Follows edges
    specific_edges <- E<Follows>

    // Select a specific Follows edge by ID
    follow_edge <- E<Follows>(edgeID)

    // Select multiple Follows edges by IDs
    other_edges <- E<Follows>(edgeID, "other_edge_id")

    RETURN edges, specific_edges, follow_edge, other_edges
}
```
</Accordion>

## Traversal Operations

Once you've selected your starting points, these operations allow you to navigate through the graph.

### Vertex-to-Vertex Navigation

Move from vertices to their connected vertices.

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `::Out` | Traverse to vertices connected by outgoing edges |
| `::Out<EdgeType>` | Traverse to vertices connected by outgoing edges of specific type |
| `::In` | Traverse to vertices connected by incoming edges |
| `::In<EdgeType>` | Traverse to vertices connected by incoming edges of specific type |
| `::Both` | Traverse to vertices connected by edges in either direction |
| `::Both<EdgeType>` | Traverse to vertices connected by edges of specific type in either direction |

<Accordion title="Example: Vertex-to-Vertex Navigation">
```rust
QUERY GetFriendsAndFollowers(userID: String) {
    // Find user by ID
    user <- V<User>(userID)

    // Get users that this user follows (outgoing direction)
    following <- user::Out<Follows>

    // Get users that follow this user (incoming direction)
    followers <- user::In<Follows>

    // Get all connections in both directions
    connections <- user::Both<Follows>

    RETURN following, followers, connections
}
```
</Accordion>

### Vertex-to-Edge Navigation

Move from vertices to their connected edges.

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `::OutE` | Get outgoing edges from vertices |
| `::OutE<EdgeType>` | Get outgoing edges of specific type |
| `::InE` | Get incoming edges to vertices |
| `::InE<EdgeType>` | Get incoming edges of specific type |
| `::BothE` | Get edges in either direction |
| `::BothE<EdgeType>` | Get edges of specific type in either direction |

<Accordion title="Example: Vertex-to-Edge Navigation">
```rust
QUERY GetUserRelationships(userID: String) {
    // Find user by ID
    user <- V<User>(userID)

    // Get all outgoing relationship edges
    outgoing_relationships <- user::OutE

    // Get only outgoing "Follows" edges
    follows_edges <- user::OutE<Follows>

    // Get incoming "Follows" edges
    followed_by_edges <- user::InE<Follows>

    RETURN outgoing_relationships, follows_edges, followed_by_edges
}
```
</Accordion>

### Edge-to-Vertex Navigation

Move from edges to their connected vertices.

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `::OutV` | Get source vertex (where edge starts) |
| `::InV` | Get target vertex (where edge ends) |
| `::BothV` | Get both source and target vertices |

<Accordion title="Example: Edge-to-Vertex Navigation">
```rust
QUERY GetFollowRelationshipDetails(relationshipID: String) {
    // Find a specific Follows relationship by ID
    relationship <- E<Follows>(relationshipID)

    // Get the user who initiated the follow (source)
    follower <- relationship::OutV

    // Get the user being followed (target)
    followed <- relationship::InV

    // Get both users involved in the relationship
    both_users <- relationship::BothV

    RETURN follower, followed, both_users
}
```
</Accordion>

## Combining Traversal Steps

HQL allows you to chain traversal operations to create complex graph queries.

<Accordion title="Example: Chained Traversal">
```rust
QUERY GetFriendsOfFriends(userID: String) {
    // Find user by ID
    user <- V<User>(userID)

    // Get users that this user follows
    following <- user::Out<Follows>

    // Get users that those users follow (friends of friends)
    friends_of_friends <- following::Out<Follows>

    RETURN following, friends_of_friends
}
```
</Accordion>
