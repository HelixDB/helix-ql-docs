# HelixDB Overview

HelixDB is a high-performance graph database designed for modern applications that require complex relationship modeling and traversal. It combines the power of graph data structures with efficient storage and query capabilities.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for fast traversals and complex relationship queries
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity with full transaction support
- **Native Graph Storage**: Purpose-built storage engine optimized for graph operations
- **Native Vector Storage**: Purpose-built storage engine optimized for vector operations
- **Flexible Schema**: Supports both schema-full and schema-less approaches
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simple setup and intuitive APIs

## Architecture

HelixDB uses a distributed architecture with the following components:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Storage Layer">
    Efficiently stores vertices, edges, and their properties using a specialized graph storage format that optimizes for both read and write operations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Vector Layer">
    Provides vector embeddings for semantic search and similarity queries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Query Engine">
    Processes and optimizes Helix Query Language (HQL) statements, transforming them into efficient execution plans.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transaction Manager">
    Ensures ACID compliance across operations, managing concurrent access and maintaining data consistency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Index Manager">
    Maintains indexes for fast property and topology lookups, significantly improving query performance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cluster Manager">
    Handles distribution and replication in multi-node deployments, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data Model

HelixDB follows the property graph model, which consists of:

- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Represent entities with unique identifiers and properties
- **Vectors**: Represent entities with unique identifiers and vector embeddings
- **Edges**: Represent relationships between vertices, with directionality and properties
- **Properties**: Key-value pairs attached to both vertices and edges
- **Labels**: Categorize vertices and edges by type

This model allows for rich representation of complex domains while maintaining query performance.

## Performance Characteristics

HelixDB is designed for high performance across various workloads:

| Operation Type | Performance Characteristics |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Vertex Lookup by ID | O(1) - Constant time |
| Edge Traversal | O(log n) - Where n is the number of edges |
| Property Filtering | O(1) with indexes, O(n) without |
| Complex Pattern Matching | Optimized with adaptive query planning |
| Write Operations | Optimized with batch processing and parallel execution |

## Use Cases

HelixDB excels in scenarios where relationships between data points are as important as the data itself:
