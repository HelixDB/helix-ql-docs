# Getting Started With Helix-MCP
HelixDB conveniently has custom MCP endpoints built into it making it easy for AI agents to interface
with it. We also provide an MCP server that you can hook right up to any LLM provider you're using!
We'll walk through how to do this with Claude Desktop. For more information on installing Claude
Desktop, click [here](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10065433-installing-claude-for-desktop).

First start off by fetching the mcp server:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelixDB/helix-py/refs/heads/main/apps/mcp_server.py
```

Then you'll want to setup a `uv` project so that you can install the dependencies. You'll want to run:
```bash
uv init project
cp mcp_server.py project
cd project
```

Then setup a virtual environment and install the servers dependencies:
```bash
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv add helix-py "mcp[cli]"
```

Finally, copy this configuration into `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
assuming you're on Mac OS. If not, copy this snippet to wherever your claude desktop config is located.
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "helix-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/Users/user/Downloads/project",
        "run",
        "mcp_server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Don't forget to adjust the path to your `mcp_server.py` in the snippet!

### Setting up HelixDB
Before running the server in Claude Desktop, you also want to make sure that you have an actual running
Helix instance. See our [installation guide](../../documentation/getting-started/installation) for that.
