# Exporting SQL Data and Ingesting into Helix

This guide will walk you through the process of exporting your SQL data, uploading it to a website, and then to Amazon S3. Finally, the data will be ingested into a Helix instance and written to a graph database. This process currently supports PostgreSQL.

### Steps

1. **SSH into the Instance**

   First, SSH into the instance that has access to your PostgreSQL database.
   Ensure this instance can access the database you want to ingest.

   ```bash
   ssh user@your-instance-ip
   ```

2. **Install Helix CLI**

   Install the Helix CLI using the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL "https://install.helix-db.com" | bash
   ```

3. **Ingest Data into Helix**

   Run the following command to ingest data from your PostgreSQL database into Helix:

   ```bash
   helix ingest -t pg --db "postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>" -i <instance-name> --ssl
   ```

   - Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<host>`, `<port>`, and `<dbname>` with your PostgreSQL credentials and connection details.

| Short Flag | Long Flag    | Description                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-i`       | `--instance` | Specifies the name of the instance you are uploading for.               |
| `-t`       | `--type`     | Specifies the database type, which is `pg` for PostgreSQL               |
| `-s`       | `--ssl`      | Required for dbs in the cloud like AWS RDS but not for local databases. |

4. **Upload Data to S3**

   After exporting your data, download it and go to the [Helix Console](https://helix-db.com/dashboard) and upload the data.

5. **Helix Instance Pulls Data**

   Once it has been uploaded, the Helix instance will pull the data and write it to the graph database.

### Future Enhancements

- **Vector Support**: Support for vectors will be added soon, enhancing the capabilities of data ingestion and processing.

This process ensures that your data is securely transferred and ingested into the Helix graph database, ready for analysis and use.
