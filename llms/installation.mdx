# Installation
@tags: install, cli, setup, docker, prerequisites, quickstart

## Prerequisites
- Rust version 1.88.0 or higher (required)
- Docker Desktop for local development (required)
- Git for first-time Helix source cache (required)
- Cloud CLIs: AWS CLI, Fly CLI for cloud deployment (optional)

## Install Steps

1. **Install Helix CLI**
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.helix-db.com | bash
   ```
   Note: Run `helix update` to upgrade; `helix migrate` to migrate existing projects from CLI v1 to CLI v2.

2. **Create project**
   ```bash
   helix init
   ```
   Creates a new project in the current directory with `helix.toml` file and `db` directory containing `schema.hx` and `queries.hx` files.
   Read the `helix.toml` file for more information about the configuration.

3. **Define schema and queries**
    Define the [schema and queries](https://helix-llms-txt.mintlify.app/llms/hql-intro.md) in the `schema.hx` and `queries.hx` files in the `db` directory.
    There will be default schema and queries commented out at the top of the files for you.

4. **Build and deploy locally**
    Build and deploy the project to the local HelixDB instance.
    ```bash
    helix push dev
    ```
    Replace `<dev>` with the actual name of the instance.
    Check the [CLI commands](https://helix-llms-txt.mintlify.app/llms/cli.md#commands) for more information about the build and deploy process.
    Once Helix CLI is installed and your instance is initialized, continue to [configurations](https://helix-llms-txt.mintlify.app/llms/cli.md#configurations) to customize ports and instances or jump to [HelixDB SDKs](https://helix-llms-txt.mintlify.app/llms/sdks.md) or cURL to test your first query.

5. **Test connection**
    - If you are using a local HelixDB instance, verify that it now runs inside Docker on port designated in the `helix.toml` file (usually `6969`).
    - Calling a query in the `queries.hx` file should return the expected result. Replace `<port>`, `<query_name>`, and `<parameter_name>` with the actual port, query name, and parameter name. Remember to run create query first before running read, update, delete queries.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:<port>/<query_name> \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{<parameter_name>: <parameter_value>, ...}'
    ```

## Best Practices

- **Development**
  - Run `helix check` before every deploy
  - Use descriptive instance names
  - Keep dev/prod configs separate
  - Clean unused resources with `helix prune`
  - Version-control `helix.toml`

- **Production**
  - Set `build_mode = "release"`
  - Tune vector parameters to data scale
  - Enable monitoring & logging
  - Automate backups
  - Test migrations in staging first

- **Security**
  - Never commit credentials
  - Use env vars for secrets
  - Rotate API keys regularly
  - Keep CLI updated: `helix update`
  - Use private instances for prod data
