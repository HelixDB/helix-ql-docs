## What are HelixDB's key features?

HelixDB provides:

- **High Performance**: Purpose-built storage engine optimized for both graph and vector operations
- **Type Safety**: Explicit type definitions to ensure data integrity
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simple setup and migration
- **Secure**: Options for encryption at rest

## How does HelixDB store data?

HelixDB uses a property graph model with three core components:

- **Nodes**: Represent entities with unique identifiers and properties
  ```js
  N::NodeType {
    field1: String,
    field2: U32
  }
  ```
- **Vectors**: Represent entities with unique identifiers and vector embeddings
  ```js
  V::VectorType {
    field1: String,
    field2: U32
  }
  ```
- **Edges**: Represent relationships between nodes and/or vectors, with directionality and properties
  ```js
  E::EdgeType {
    From: String,
    To: String,
    Properties: {
      field1: String,
      field2: U32
    }
  }
  ```

This model allows for rich representation of complex domains while maintaining query performance.
