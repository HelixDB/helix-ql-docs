## Conceptual differences between Cypher and HelixQL

Cypher is a query language for graph databases that is similar to SQL. HelixQL is a query language for graph and vector databases that takes inspiration from Gremlin in a more procedural way.

## Select statements

In this section we cover the differences between selecting nodes, edges and vectors in Cypher and HelixQL.

### Selecting Nodes
<CodeGroup>

```cypher Cypher
MATCH (n:User) RETURN n as users
```

```rust HelixQL
QUERY GetUsers () =>
    users <- N<User>
    RETURN users
```
</CodeGroup>

### Vector Search

<CodeGroup>

```cypher Cypher
MATCH (n:Document)
WHERE n.embedding IS NOT NULL
WITH n, vector.similarity.cosine(n.embedding, $queryVector) AS score
RETURN n, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
```

```rust HelixQL
QUERY SearchDocuments (vector: [F64]) =>
    documents <- SearchV<Document>(vector)::Range(0,10)
    RETURN documents
```
</CodeGroup>

### Traversals

<CodeGroup>

```cypher Cypher
MATCH (n:User)-[:FOLLOWS]->(m:User) 
WHERE id(n) = $user_id
RETURN m
```

```rust HelixQL
QUERY GetFollowers (user_id: ID) =>
    followers <- N<User>(user_id)::Out<Follows>
    RETURN followers
```
</CodeGroup>

### Conditionals

<CodeGroup>

```cypher Cypher
MATCH (n:User)-[:FOLLOWS]->(m:User)-[:POSTED]->(p:Post)
WHERE id(n) = $user_id
    AND p.created_at > datetime($since)
RETURN DISTINCT m
LIMIT 20
```

```rust HelixQL
QUERY GetFollowers (user_id: ID, since: Date) =>
    followers <- N<User>(user_id)::Out<Follows>
                    ::WHERE(_::Out<Posted>::{created_at}::GT(since))
                    ::Range(0, 20)
    RETURN followers
```
</CodeGroup>

## Creating

Here we cover the differences between creating nodes, edges and vectors in Cypher and HelixQL.

### Creating Nodes

<CodeGroup>

```cypher Cypher
CREATE (user:User { name: "Alice", age: 30 })
```

```rust HelixQL
QUERY CreateUser (name: String, age: U8) =>
    user <- AddN<User>({ name: name, age: age })
    RETURN user
```
</CodeGroup>

### Creating Edges

<CodeGroup>

```cypher Cypher
MATCH (user1:User), (user2:User { name: "Bob" })
WHERE elementId(a) = $user1_id
CREATE (user1)-[:FOLLOWS]->(user2)
```

```rust HelixQL
QUERY CreateFollow (user1_id: ID) =>
    user2 <- N<User>({name: "Bob"})
    follows <- AddE<Follows>::From(user1_id)::To(user2)
    RETURN follows
```
</CodeGroup>

### Creating Vectors

<CodeGroup>

```cypher Cypher
CREATE (n:Document {
  title: 'My Doc',
  embedding: $vector
})
```

```rust HelixQL
QUERY CreateVector (vector: [F64]) =>
    document <- AddV<Document>(vector, {title: "My Doc"})
    RETURN document
```
</CodeGroup>
