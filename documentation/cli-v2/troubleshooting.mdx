## Common Errors

### Not in a Helix project

```
Not in a Helix project directory. Run 'helix init' to create one.
```

Fix: run `helix init` in your project directory, or `cd` into a folder containing `helix.toml`.

### Docker not available

Symptoms: build/push/start/prune commands fail with Docker errors.

Fix:
- Install Docker Desktop and start the daemon
- Ensure your user has permission to use Docker

### No schema definitions found

```
error: no schema definitions found in project
```

Fix: ensure `./db/schema.hx` contains at least one `N::` node or `E::` edge definition.

### Compilation failed (query errors)

`helix check` and `helix build` run parsing and analysis. The output will include file paths and hints. Resolve errors in `.hx` files and rerun.

### Fly.io auth errors

Fix:
- Install `flyctl` and run `flyctl auth login`
- If using API key auth, create `~/.helix/helix.env` with `FLY_API_KEY=...`

### AWS CLI errors / ECR push fails

Fix:
- Install `aws` CLI and run `aws configure`
- Ensure the user has ECR permissions

### Helix Cloud auth missing

```
Credentials file not found
```

Fix: run `helix auth login`. Credentials are stored at `~/.helix/credentials`.
