The CLI v2 uses `helix.toml` at the project root. It defines the project name, queries directory, and instance configurations.

## helix.toml

```toml
[project]
name = "my-helix-app"
queries = "./db/"

[local.dev]
port = 6969
build_mode = "debug" # dev | debug | release
mcp = true
bm25 = true

[local.dev.vector_config]
m = 16
ef_construction = 128
ef_search = 768
db_max_size_gb = 20

[local.dev.graph_config]
secondary_indices = []

# Cloud instances may be present under [cloud]
[cloud.production]
type = "helix" # helix | flyio | ecr
cluster_id = "helix-prod-..."
region = "us-east-1"
build_mode = "release"
mcp = true
bm25 = true
```

Notes:

- Vector and graph configs mirror the v1 `config.hx.json` fields and defaults.
- `build_mode` controls Docker image tags and build targets.
- `queries` is the folder where `.hx` files live (e.g., `schema.hx`, `queries.hx`).

## Instance Resolution

The CLI reads `helix.toml` to resolve instances. Use `helix status` to list configured instances and types.

## Legacy Compatibility

When building, `config.hx.json` is generated into the instance workspace to preserve compatibility with the engine/runtime.

## Environment & Credentials

- Helix Cloud credentials: `~/.helix/credentials`
- Fly.io API key (when using API auth): `~/.helix/helix.env` with `FLY_API_KEY=...`
