The Helix CLI v2 provides a streamlined developer experience with a modern project format (`helix.toml`), instance-aware workflows, and integrations for local Docker, Fly.io, AWS ECR, and Helix Cloud.

## Highlights

- Project-centric: `helix.toml` tracks project and instance config
- Strong validation: `helix check` and `helix compile` catch issues early
- Seamless local dev: Docker-based builds with generated `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- Cloud integrations: Fly.io and AWS ECR flows, plus Helix Cloud authentication and deploy
- Metrics opt-in: control telemetry with `helix metrics`

## Typical Flow

```bash
helix init
helix check
helix build dev
helix push dev
helix status
```

See the rest of the CLI v2 section for details, examples, and troubleshooting.
