## Access Your Configs

The configuration for HelixDB is a json file named `config.hx.json`
This file will be created when you run `helix init --path helixdb-cfg`.

## Config Options

### Vector Configs

- `m`: Maximum number of connections each node can have at each layer of the graph (default 16)
- `ef_construction`: Size of dynamic list of candidates considered during vector insertion (default 128)
- `ef_search`: Size of the dynamic list of candidates maintained during the search process (default 768)

| Parameter         | Effect                                 | Higher Value                                                        | Lower Value                                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `m`               | Controls graph connectivity            | Richly connected graph with better pathfinding                      | Sparse graph with faster construction but worse pathfinding       |
| `ef_construction` | Size of candidate list during indexing | High-quality, accurate index but more indexing time and memory      | Faster indexing but can miss some connections & degrade recall    |
| `ef_search`       | Candidate pool size during query       | Wider search scope, improving recall and accuracy but slower search | Narrower search scope, faster search but more approximate results |

### Graph Configs

- `secondary_indices`: List of secondary indices for graph operations (default empty)

### Database Configs

- `db_max_size_gb`: The maximum size of the database in GB (default 10)
- `mcp`: Enable MCP support (default true)
