## Schema Definition

HelixQL uses a schema definition to define the structure of the graph.
Note that every node, edge and vector has an implicit `ID` field. that is not in the schema definition.

### Node Schema

Defines node types and their properties in the graph.

```rust
N::NodeType {
  field1: String,
  field2: U32
}
```

---

### Edge Schema

Defines relationships between nodes and their properties.

```rust
E::EdgeType {
  From: String,
  To: String,
  Properties: {
    field1: String,
    field2: U32
  }
}
```

---

### Vector Schema

Defines the vector type.

```rust
V::VectorType {
  field1: [F64]
}
```
