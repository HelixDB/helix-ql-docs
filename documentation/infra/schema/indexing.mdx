To do this, you can use the `INDEX` keyword.

```rust
N::NodeType {
  INDEX field1: String,
  field2: U32
}
```

This internally creates a table for the indexed field.
To query a node by the indexed field, you can use object syntax:

```rust
QUERY getByIndex(index_field: String) =>
    node <- N<User>({field1: index_field})
    RETURN node
```

You must also add it into your `config.hx.json` file:
```json
"graph_config": {
    "secondary_indices": ["field1"]
},
```

**Note:** You can currectly only use indexing with nodes. Indexing for edges and vectors is not supported yet.
