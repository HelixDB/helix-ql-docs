[helix-ts](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-ts) is a TypeScript library for interacting with [helix-db](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-db) a powerful graph-vector database written in rust. It enables intuitive and type-safe access to graph-based and vector-based queries, making it ideal for building knowledge graphs, search systems, and LLM pipelines.

## Installation

```bash
npm install helix-ts
```

## Setup
To setup a simple `Client` to interface with a running helix instance:
```typescript
import HelixDB from "helix-ts";

// Create a new HelixDB client 
const client = new HelixDB("https://localhost:6969");
```
The default URL is `http://localhost:6969`. For cloud deployments, simply pass in the appropriate URL to the constructor.

## Queries
**helix-ts** has a simple interface for creating queries. First, you can create a new client with the endpoint of your helix instance.
Then you can start running queries by passing the query name and an argument object matching the queryâ€™s expected inputs.

```typescript
// Query the database
// Note that the query name is case sensitive
await client.query("addUser", {
    name: "John",
    age: 20
});

// Get the user
const user = await client.query("getUser", {
    name: "John"
});

console.log(user);
```
> Make sure the argument keys match the expected parameter names in your helix query.
