[**helix-py**](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-py) is a Python library for interacting with [helix-db](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-db),
a powerful graph-vector database written in Rust. It provides both a simple query interface and a PyTorch-like
front-end for defining and executing custom graph queries and vector-based operations. This makes it
well-suited for use cases such as similarity search, knowledge graph construction, and machine learning pipelines.

> helix-py is evolving into a full-fledged knowledge graph framework. Expect major updates in version v0.3.0.

## Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash uv
uv add helix-py
```

```bash pip
pip install helix-py
```

</CodeGroup>

## Queries
[**helix-py**](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-py) allows users to define a PyTorch-like manner, similar to how
you would define a neural network's forward pass. You can use built-in queries in `helix/client.py`
to get started with inserting and search vectors, or you can define your own queries for more complex workflows.

**Pytorch-like Query**

Given a HelixQL query like this:
```rust query.hx
QUERY add_user(name: String, age: I64) =>
  usr <- AddV<User>({name: name, age: age})
  RETURN usr
```

You can define a matching Python class:
```python Python
from helix.client import Query
from helix.types import Payload

class add_user(Query):
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def query(self) -> Payload:
        return [{ "name": self.name, "age": self.age }]

    def response(self, response):
        return response
```

## Client
To setup a simple `Client` to interface with a running helix instance:

```python Python
import helix
from helix.client import hnswinsert, hnswsearch

# Connect to a local helix instance
db = helix.Client(local=True, verbose=True)

# Load and insert data
data = helix.Loader("path/to/data", cols=["vecs"])
[db.query(hnswinsert(d)) for d in data]

# Query for nearest neighbors
my_query = [0.32, ..., -1.321]
nearest = db.query(hnswsearch(my_query))

# Calling your own query
# Standard
db.query('add_user', {"name": "John", "age": 20})

# Pytorch-like
db.query(add_user("John", 20))
```
The default port is `6969`, but you can change it by passing in the `port` parameter.
For cloud instances, you can pass in the `api_endpoint` parameter.

## Instance
To setup a simple `Instance` that manages and automatically starts and stops a helix instance with respect
to the lifetime of the script:

```python Python
from helix.instance import Instance
helix_instance = Instance("helixdb-cfg", 6969, verbose=True)

# Deploy instance
helix_instance.deploy()

# Redeploy instance
helix_instance.redeploy()

# Start instance
helix_instance.start()

# Stop instance
helix_instance.stop()

# Delete instance
helix_instance.delete()

# Instance status
print(helix_instance.status())
```
> `helixdb-cfg` is the directory where the configuration files are stored.

and from there you can interact with the instance using `Client`.

The instance will be automatically stopped when the script exits.

## Providers
We also provide an Ollama and OpenAI interface. This will be expanded to include many other providers in the future.
```python Python
from helix.providers import OllamaClient, OpenAIClient
ollama_client = OllamaClient(use_history=True, model="mistral:latest")
openai_client = OpenAIClient(use_history=True, model="gpt-4o")

while True:
    prompt = input(">>> ")
    res = ollama_client.request(prompt, stream=True)
```

<Note>
    To use the OpenAi client, you must either pass in your OpenAI API key as `api_key` or set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
</Note>

## Loader
The loader (`helix/loader.py`) currently supports `.parquet`, `.fvecs`, and `.csv` data. Simply pass in the path to your
file or files and the columns you want to process and the loader does the rest for you and is easy to integrate with
your queries
