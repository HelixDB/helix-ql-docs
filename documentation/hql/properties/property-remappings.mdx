## Simple Remappings

Sometimes, you may want to rename a property that is returned from a traversal. 
You can access properties of an item by using the name of the property as defined
in the schema. 
```rust
::{ new_name: property_name }
```
You can use the name directly, or if you want to be more explicit, 
or in cases where there may be name clashes, you can use the `_::` operator.


### Direct Access

```rust
QUERY findUsers() =>
    users <- N<User>::RANGE(0, 10)
    RETURN users::{
        userID: ID, 
    }
```

### Explicit Access

```rust
QUERY findUsers() =>
    users <- N<User>::RANGE(0, 10)
    RETURN users::{
        givenName: _::{name}
    }
```

## Nested Mappings

If you want to access a properties that traverse from the selected element,
you can use the nested variable to continue the traversal. 
These nested mappings work similarly to closures in rust or anonymous functions in javascript.

- e.g. `|a| { a + 1 }` in rust or `(a) => { a + 1 }` in javascript.

We lean heavily on the rust syntax style for nested remappings.
The following is an overview of the syntax:

```rust
::|item_name|{
    field: item_name::traversal,
    new_field: other::{
        nested_field: item_name::ID, // here we access the ID from the outer scope
        ..
    },
}
```

The important thing to note here, is that if we were to access the `ID` like we have shown previously:
`nested_field: ID`. This ID would be the ID of the `other` item, not the `item_name` item due to the tighter scope.

### Example

```rust
QUERY findFriends(userID: String) =>
  user <- N<User>(userID)
  posts <- user::Out<Posts>::RANGE(20)
  RETURN user::|usr|{
            posts: posts::{
                postID: ID, // accesses the `postID` property from each `posts`
                creatorID: usr::ID, // accesses the `ID` property from each `usr` and maps it to `creatorID`
                ..
            },
        }
```
