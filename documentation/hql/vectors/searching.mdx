## `SearchV`

Search for vectors in your graph.

```rust
SearchV<Type>(vector, {properties})
```

### Example

In schema.hx:

```rust
V::Document {
    text: String
    created_at: I64
}
```

In query.hx:

```rust
QUERY SearchVector (vector: [F64], k: I64) =>
    // Search for the vector in the graph (returns k results)
    documents <- SearchV<Document>(vector, k)
    RETURN documents
```

<Note>
Currently, Helix only supports using an array of `F64` values to represent the vector.
We will be adding support for different types such as `F32`, binary vectors and
more in the very near future. Please reach out to us if you need a different vector type.
</Note>

## Postfiltering

You can postfilter the results of a search by adding a `WHERE` clause to the query.
The condition in the `WHERE` step must evaluate to a boolean value.

```rust
SearchV<Type>(vector)::WHERE(<boolean_expression>)
```

### Example

```rust
QUERY SearchVector (vector: [F64], now: I64) =>
    doc_vecs <- SearchV<Document>(vector)
    documents <- doc_vecs::In<DocEmbedding>::WHERE(_::{created_at}::LTE(now))
    RETURN documents
```

The condition is applied after the search has been completed.
