This operation allows you to pass in text directly for inserting and searching vectors.
The text is automatically embedded with an embedding model of your choice (can be defined
in your `config.hx.json` file). The default embedding model is `text-embedding-ada-002` from
OpenAI. Make sure to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your api key as well.

### `Embed`

Embeds the input text and returns a vector

```rust
Embed(text)
AddV<Type>(Embed(text))
```

**Example:**

In schema.hx:

```rust
V::Document {
    content: String
    created_at: I64
}
```

In query.hx:

```rust
QUERY InsertText(content: String, created_at: I64) =>
    // Create an empty user node
    basic_user <- AddV<Document>(Embed(content))
    // You could also write it like this with properties
    AddV<Document>(Embed(content), { content: content, created_at: created_at })
    RETURN basic_user
```

You can also use the `Embed` function in a search query:

```rust
QUERY SearchText(query: String) =>
    // Search for documents that are similar to the query
    results <- SearchV<Document>(Embed(query))
    RETURN results
```
