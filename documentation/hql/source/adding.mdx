### Add Node `AddN`

Create new nodes in your graph.

```rust
AddN<Type>
AddN<Type>({properties})
```

#### Example:
```rust [expandable]
QUERY CreateUsers () =>
    // Create an empty user node
    basic_user <- AddN<User>
    // You could also write it like this
    AddN<User>

    // Add a user with properties
    detailed_user <- AddN<User>({
        name: "Alice Johnson",
        age: 30,
        email: "alice@example.com"
    })

    RETURN basic_user, detailed_user
```

---

### Add Edge `AddE`

Create connections between nodes in your graph.

```rust
AddE<Type>::From(v1)::To(v2)
AddE<Type>({properties})::From(v1)::To(v2)
```

#### Example:
```rust [expandable]
QUERY CreateRelationships(user1ID: String, user2ID: String) =>
    // Get the users by their IDs
    user1 <- N<User>(user1ID)
    user2 <- N<User>(user2ID)

    // Create a simple follows relationship
    follows <- AddE<Follows>::From(user1)::To(user2)

    // Create a detailed friendship with properties
    friendship <- AddE<Friends>({
        since: "2024-01-15",
        strength: 0.85,
        tags: ["college", "roommates"]
    })::From(user1)::To(user2)

    RETURN follows, friendship
```

#### Example: Adding Edges in a Traversal

You can also use the `AddE` operation in the middle of a traversal to add edges between a list of nodes or vectors.
```rust [expandable]
QUERY CreateFriendships(user1ID: String, user2ID: String) =>
// This makes every user in the database follow the user with ID user1ID
user1 <- N<User>::AddE<Follows>::To(N(user1ID))

// This makes user with userID2 follow every user in the database
user1 <- N<User>::AddE<Follows>::From(N(user1ID))

RETURN friendship
```

---

### Add Vector `AddV`

Create new vector embeddings in your graph.

```rust
AddV<Type>
AddV<Type>(vector, {properties})
```

#### Example:

```rust
QUERY InsertVector (vector: [F64], content: String, created_at: I64) =>
    // Create an empty user node
    basic_user <- AddV<Document>(vector)
    // You could also write it like this with properties
    AddV<Document>(vector, { content: content, created_at: created_at })
    RETURN basic_user
```

<Note>
Currently, Helix only supports using an array of `F64` values to represent the vector.
We will be adding support for different types such as `F32`, binary vectors and 
more in the very near future. Please reach out to us if you need a different vector type.
