# Cannot Access Properties on the Type

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to access properties on a type that doesn't support property access, such as primitive types or certain intermediate query results.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql queries.hx
QUERY getValue(count: I32) =>
    result <- count::{value}
    RETURN result
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Ensure you are accessing properties on a node, edge, or vector type that has defined fields.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql queries.hx
QUERY getUser(id: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(id)
    result <- user::{name}
    RETURN result
```

```helixql schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
}
```
</CodeGroup>
