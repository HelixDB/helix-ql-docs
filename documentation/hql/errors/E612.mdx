# Missing From ID

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to create an edge without specifying the source node ID.

In this example, the `AddE` step is used without specifying the `From` parameter.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
Query addEdge(to: ID) =>
    AddE<Follows>::To(to)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Provide both 'from' and 'to' node IDs when creating edges.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
Query addEdge(from: ID, to: ID) =>
    AddE<Follows>::From(from)::To(to)
```
</CodeGroup>
