# Type Mismatch in Comparison

This error occurs when you compare a property with a value of a different type.

## Example

```hql
// Comparing integer property with string value
n() -> User[.age == "twenty-five"]  // age is integer, comparing with string
```

## Solution

- Ensure compared values match the property type
- Check schema for correct property data types
- Convert values to matching types before comparison
- Use appropriate comparison operators for the data types involved
