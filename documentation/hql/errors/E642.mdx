# Object Remapping Position

This error occurs when you place an object remapping operation in a position other than the last step of a traversal.

## Example

```hql
// Object remapping not at the end
n() -> User -> { name: .full_name } -> .email  // Remapping should be last
```

## Solution

- Place object remapping operations only at the end of traversals
- Ensure remapping is the final transformation step
- Restructure queries to have remapping as the last operation
- Use other transformations before applying remapping
