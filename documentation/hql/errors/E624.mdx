# Edge Type Does Not Have a Node Type as Its To Source

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to use an edge in a context that requires the `To` type to be a node, but the edge's `To` type is not a node.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
QUERY getConnections(id: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(id)
    connections <- user->LinksTo
    RETURN connections
```

```rust schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
}

V<128>::Document {
    title: String,
}

E::LinksTo {
    From: User,
    To: Document,
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Ensure the edge type has a node type as its `To` source, or use the appropriate traversal for vector types.

<CodeGroup>
```rust schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
}

N::Post {
    content: String,
}

E::Authored {
    From: User,
    To: Post,
}
```

```rust queries.hx
QUERY getPosts(id: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(id)
    posts <- user->Authored
    RETURN posts
```
</CodeGroup>
