# Exclude Position Restriction

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you place an exclude operation in a position other than the last step of a traversal or the step before an object remapping or closure remapping step.

In this example, the exclude step is used before the `Out<Knows>` step which is not allowed.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
Query getUser(userId: ID) =>
    users <- N<User>(userId)::!{email}::Out<Knows>
    RETURN users
```
</CodeGroup>
