# Exclude Position Restriction

This error occurs when you place an exclude operation in an invalid position within a traversal.

## Example

```hql
// Exclude in invalid position
n() -> User -> exclude(.password) -> .name -> .email  // Exclude not at end or before remapping/closure
```

## Solution

- Place exclude operations at the end of traversals
- Use exclude only before object remapping or closure operations
- Restructure query to have exclude in the correct position
- Review HelixQL exclude operation placement rules
