# Edge Type Does Not Have a Vector Type as Its To Source

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to use an edge in a context that requires the `To` type to be a vector type, but the edge's `To` type is not a vector.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
QUERY getRelated(id: ID) =>
    doc <- V<Document>(id)
    related <- doc->>References
    RETURN related
```

```rust schema.hx
V<128>::Document {
    title: String,
}

N::Author {
    name: String,
}

E::References {
    From: Document,
    To: Author,
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Set the `To` type of the edge to a vector type.

<CodeGroup>
```rust schema.hx
V<128>::Document {
    title: String,
}

V<128>::Citation {
    source: String,
}

E::References {
    From: Document,
    To: Citation,
}
```

```rust queries.hx
QUERY getRelated(id: ID) =>
    doc <- V<Document>(id)
    citations <- doc->>References
    RETURN citations
```
</CodeGroup>
