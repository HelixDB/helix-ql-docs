# DROP Can Only Be Applied to Traversals

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to use `DROP` on an expression that is not a traversal.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql queries.hx
QUERY deleteValue(value: String) =>
    DROP value
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Ensure `DROP` is applied to a traversal that returns nodes, edges, or vectors.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql queries.hx
QUERY deleteUser(id: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(id)
    DROP user
```

```helixql schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
}
```
</CodeGroup>
