# Update Restriction

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to perform an update operation on something other than nodes or edges.

In this example, the `update` step is used on a vector type which is not allowed **yet**.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
Query updateVector(vectorId: ID) =>
    vector <- V<Vector>(vectorId)::UPDATE({field1: "updated value"})
```

```rust schema.hx
V::Vector {
    field1: String,
}
```
</CodeGroup>
