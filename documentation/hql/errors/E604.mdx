# Update Restriction

This error occurs when you try to perform an update operation on something other than nodes or edges.

## Example

```hql
// Trying to update a non-node/edge entity
n() -> .property -> update { new_value: "test" }  // Properties can't be updated directly
```

## Solution

- Ensure update operations target nodes or edges only
- Use proper update syntax for node/edge modifications
- Access nodes or edges before applying update operations
- Review HelixQL update documentation for correct usage
