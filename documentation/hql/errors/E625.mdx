# Edge Type Does Not Have a Vector Type as Its From Source

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to use an edge in a context that requires the `From` type to be a vector type, but the edge's `From` type is not a vector.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
QUERY getRelated(id: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(id)
    related <- user->>SimilarTo
    RETURN related
```

```rust schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
}

E::SimilarTo {
    From: User,
    To: User,
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Set the `From` type of the edge to a vector type.

<CodeGroup>
```rust schema.hx
V<128>::Document {
    title: String,
}

E::SimilarTo {
    From: Document,
    To: Document,
}
```

```rust queries.hx
QUERY getRelated(id: ID) =>
    doc <- V<Document>(id)
    related <- doc->>SimilarTo
    RETURN related
```
</CodeGroup>
