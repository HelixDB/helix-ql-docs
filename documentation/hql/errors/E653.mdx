# Non-Object Inner Type

This error occurs when the inner type of an iterable variable is not an object type, preventing field access.

## Example

```hql
// Trying to access fields on primitive inner type
for number in numbers { number.field }  // numbers contains primitives, not objects
```

## Solution

- Ensure iterable contains object types for field access
- Check the inner type of your collection
- Use appropriate operations for primitive types
- Verify collection structure matches your access patterns
