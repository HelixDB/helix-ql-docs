# Duplicate Field Name in Schema

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you define the same field name more than once within a single node, edge, or vector type.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
    age: U32,
    name: String,
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Remove the duplicate field or rename one of them.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
    age: U32,
}
```
</CodeGroup>
