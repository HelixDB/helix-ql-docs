# Invalid Step

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to use a step that is not valid in the current context.

In this example, the `OutE<Knows>` step results in edges, but the `Out` step can only be used on nodes.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
Query getUser() =>
    user <- N<User>::OutE<Knows>::Out<Knows>
    RETURN user
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Use valid step types in your traversals.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
Query getUser() =>
    user <- N<User>::Out<Knows>::Out<Knows>
    RETURN user
```
</CodeGroup>
