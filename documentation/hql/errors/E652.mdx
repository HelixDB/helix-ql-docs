# Invalid Field Access

This error occurs when you try to access a field that doesn't exist on the inner type of an iterable variable.

## Example

```hql
// Accessing non-existent field in iteration
for user in users { user.nonexistent_field }  // Field doesn't exist on user type
```

## Solution

- Verify field names exist on the inner type
- Check schema for available fields on the iterated type
- Ensure correct field spelling and case
- Review type definitions for proper field access
