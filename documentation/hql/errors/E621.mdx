# Invalid Boolean Comparison

This error occurs when you try to apply a boolean comparison operation to a type that doesn't support it.

## Example

```hql
// Invalid boolean comparison on incompatible type
n() -> User[.profile && .name]  // Can't use && on non-boolean types
```

## Solution

- Ensure boolean operations are used with boolean values
- Check data types before applying boolean comparisons
- Use appropriate comparison operators for different data types
- Convert values to boolean if necessary and supported
