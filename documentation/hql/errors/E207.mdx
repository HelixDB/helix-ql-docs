# E207 - Invalid Edge Type for Item

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to use an edge type that exists in the schema but is not valid for the specific item type you're working with.

In this example, the `Created` edge exists. However, it goes from `User` to `Post`, not from `Post` to `User`. 
Therefore, it is not valid for an `Out` step from a `Post` node.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
Query getUserFromPost(postId: ID) =>
    user <- N<Post>(postId)::Out<Created>
```

```rust schema.hx
N::User {
    // Fields
}

N::Post {
    // Fields
}

E::Created {
    From: User,
    To: Post,
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

In this case, the solution would be to change the traversal to use the `In` step instead of the `Out` step.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
Query getUserFromPost(postId: ID) =>
    user <- N<Post>(postId)::In<Created>
```
</CodeGroup>
