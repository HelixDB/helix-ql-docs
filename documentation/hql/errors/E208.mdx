# SearchV Type Restriction

This error occurs when you try to use the `searchv` function on a type that is not a vector type.

## Example

```hql
// Trying to use searchv on a non-vector type
searchv(User, [1.0, 2.0, 3.0])  // User is not a vector type
```

## Solution

- Ensure you're using `searchv` only with vector types
- Check your schema for proper vector type definitions
- Use appropriate search functions for non-vector types
- Verify the type you're searching is configured for vector operations
