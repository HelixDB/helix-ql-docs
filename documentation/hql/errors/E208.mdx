# Field Has Not Been Indexed

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to use a field in an operation that requires the field to be indexed, but the field has not been marked with `INDEX` in the schema.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
QUERY findUserByEmail(email: String) =>
    users <- N<User>::WHERE(|u| u.email == email)
    RETURN users
```

```rust schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
    email: String,
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Add the `INDEX` modifier to the field in your schema.

<CodeGroup>
```rust schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
    email: String INDEX,
}
```
</CodeGroup>
