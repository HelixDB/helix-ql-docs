# Variable Not in Scope

This error occurs when you try to reference a variable that is not currently in scope or has not been declared.

## Example

```hql
// Trying to use an undeclared variable
n() -> User -> .name as user_name;
other_query() -> .id == undeclared_var  // Error: undeclared_var not in scope
```

## Solution

- Ensure variables are declared before use
- Check variable naming for typos
- Verify variable scope and accessibility
- Make sure variables are declared in the correct context
