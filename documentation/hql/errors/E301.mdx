# Variable Not in Scope

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to reference a variable that is not currently in scope or has not been declared.

In this example, the variable `userId` is not declared.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql queries.hx
Query getUser() =>
    user <- N<User>(userId)
    RETURN user
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Declare the variable as a parameter before using it.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql queries.hx
Query getUser(userId: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(userId)
    RETURN user
```
</CodeGroup>
