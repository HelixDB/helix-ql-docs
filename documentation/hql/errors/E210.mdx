# Identifier Expected to be of Type ID

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when an identifier is expected to be of type ID but a different type was provided.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
QUERY getUser(userId: String) =>
    user <- N<User>(userId)
    RETURN user
```

```rust schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Ensure the identifier is of type ID.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
QUERY getUser(userId: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(userId)
    RETURN user
```

```rust schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
}
```
</CodeGroup>
