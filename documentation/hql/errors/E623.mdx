# Edge Type Does Not Have a Node Type as Its From Source

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to use an edge in a context that requires the `From` type to be a node, but the edge's `From` type is not a node.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql queries.hx
QUERY getConnections(id: ID) =>
    doc <- V<Document>(id)
    connections <- doc->Related
    RETURN connections
```

```helixql schema.hx
V<128>::Document {
    title: String,
}

E::Related {
    From: Document,
    To: Document,
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Ensure the edge type has a node type as its `From` source, or use the appropriate traversal for vector types.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
}

E::Follows {
    From: User,
    To: User,
}
```

```helixql queries.hx
QUERY getFollowing(id: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(id)
    following <- user->Follows
    RETURN following
```
</CodeGroup>
