# Closure Position Restriction

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you place a closure operation in a position other than the last step of a traversal.

In this example, the closure is not at the end of the traversal.

<CodeGroup>

```rust queries.hx
Query getUser(userId: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(userId)
    RETURN user::|u|{
                userID: u::ID
            }::Out<Knows>
```
</CodeGroup>

# Solution

Place closure operations only at the end of traversals.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
Query getUser(userId: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(userId)
    out_users <- user::Out<Knows>
    RETURN out_users, user::|u|{
                            userID: u::ID
                        }::Out<Knows>
```
</CodeGroup>
