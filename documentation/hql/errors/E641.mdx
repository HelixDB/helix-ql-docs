# Closure Position Restriction

This error occurs when you place a closure operation in a position other than the last step of a traversal.

## Example

```hql
// Closure not at the end of traversal
n() -> User -> { .name, .age } -> .email  // Closure should be last
```

## Solution

- Place closure operations only at the end of traversals
- Restructure your query to have closures as final steps
- Use other operations before applying closures
- Review HelixQL traversal structure requirements
