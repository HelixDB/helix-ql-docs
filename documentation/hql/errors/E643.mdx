# Field Previously Excluded

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to access or include a field that has been previously excluded in the traversal.

In this example, the `email` field is excluded in the traversal, but is being accessed.

<CodeGroup>

```helixql queries.hx
Query getUser(userId: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(userId)::!{email}
    RETURN user::{email}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Remove the exclusion or access the field after the exclusion.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql queries.hx
Query getUser(userId: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(userId)
    RETURN user::{email}
```
</CodeGroup>
