# Field Previously Excluded

This error occurs when you try to access or include a field that has been previously excluded in the traversal.

## Example

```hql
// Trying to access excluded field
n() -> User -> exclude(.email) -> .email  // email was excluded
```

## Solution

- Don't access fields that have been excluded
- Remove exclusion if you need to access the field later
- Restructure query to access fields before excluding them
- Review field exclusion logic in your traversal
