# Reserved Field Name

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to use a reserved field name in your schema or query.

For example, the field `id` is a reserved field name for any item type.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql schema.hx
N::User {
    id: String,
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Rename the field to a valid identifier.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql schema.hx
N::User {
    github_id: String,
}
```
</CodeGroup>
