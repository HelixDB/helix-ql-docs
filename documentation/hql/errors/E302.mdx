# Variable Previously Declared

This error occurs when you try to declare a variable that has already been declared in the current scope.

## Example

```hql
// Declaring the same variable twice
n() -> User -> .name as user_name;
n() -> Product -> .title as user_name  // Error: user_name already declared
```

## Solution

- Use unique variable names within the same scope
- Choose different variable names for different values
- Check for duplicate variable declarations
- Consider using more descriptive variable names to avoid conflicts
