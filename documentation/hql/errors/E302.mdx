# Variable Previously Declared

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to declare a variable that has already been declared in the current scope.
In this example, the variable `user_name` is declared twice.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
Query getUser(userId: ID) =>
    userId <- N<User>(userId)::ID
    RETURN userId
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Use a different variable name.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
Query getUser(userId: ID) =>
    user_id <- N<User>(userId)::ID
    RETURN user_id
```
</CodeGroup>
