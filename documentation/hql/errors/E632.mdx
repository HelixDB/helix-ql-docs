# Invalid Range Order

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when the start value of a range is greater than or equal to the end value.
This error is only emitted by the compiler when both start and end values are provided as literals. 
A runtime error will be emitted if the range is not valid at runtime.

In this example, the start value is greater than the end value.

<CodeGroup>

```rust queries.hx
Query getUser() =>
    subset_of_users <- N<User>::RANGE(100, 10)
    RETURN subset_of_users
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Ensure range start value is less than end value.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
Query getUser() =>
    subset_of_users <- N<User>::RANGE(10, 100)
    RETURN subset_of_users
```
</CodeGroup>
