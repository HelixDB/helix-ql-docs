# Empty Object Remapping

This error occurs when you define an object remapping with no fields.

## Example

```hql
// Empty object remapping
n() -> User -> { }  // No fields specified in remapping
```

## Solution

- Include at least one field in object remapping operations
- Define the fields you want to include or transform
- Remove remapping if no transformation is needed
- Check remapping syntax and field specifications
