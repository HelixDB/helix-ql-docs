# Cannot Access Properties on This Type

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to access properties on a type that doesn't support property access.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
QUERY getValue(x: I32) =>
    result <- x::{value}
    RETURN result
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Ensure you are accessing properties on a node, edge, or vector type that has defined fields, not on primitive types.

<CodeGroup>
```rust queries.hx
QUERY getUser(id: ID) =>
    user <- N<User>(id)
    result <- user::{name}
    RETURN result
```

```rust schema.hx
N::User {
    name: String,
}
```
</CodeGroup>
