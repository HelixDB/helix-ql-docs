# Schema Item Name is a Reserved Type Name

## Erroneous Code Example

This error occurs when you try to use a reserved type name as the name for a node, edge, or vector type.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql schema.hx
N::String {
    value: String,
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Solution

Rename the type to something that is not a reserved type name.

<CodeGroup>
```helixql schema.hx
N::TextValue {
    value: String,
}
```
</CodeGroup>
