## `DROP`

Drops elements from your database. The `DROP` effects the elements returned by the traversal.

```rust
DROP <traversal>
```
You can use the drop on any traversal that returns a list of elements. 
`DROP` will do nothing if the result of the expression is not a list of elements or if the list is empty.

### Example

```rust
QUERY DeleteUser(userID: ID) =>
    // Drop all the Out nodes and edges of the user
    DROP N<User>(userID)::Out<Follows>

    // Drop all the In nodes and edges of the user
    DROP N<User>(userID)::In<Follows>

    // Drop all the Out edges of the user
    DROP N<User>(userID)::OutE<Follows>

    // Drop all the In edges of the user
    DROP N<User>(userID)::InE<Follows>

    // Drop the user's node
    DROP N<User>(userID)

    RETURN "Success"
```

<Note>
Currently, Helix does not support deleting vectors from the graph. 
As a workaround, you can delete the node and/or the edge that the vector is attached to.
