### `COUNT`

Count the number of elements in a traversal.

```rust
::COUNT
```

**Example:**

```rust
QUERY UserStatistics() =>
    user_count <- N<User>::COUNT
    RETURN user_count
```

---

### `RANGE`

Get a range of elements from a traversal. 
The range is inclusive of the start, but exclusive of the end. 
e.g. `RANGE(0, 10)` will return 10 elements 0 through 9.

Both the start and end are required, and must be a positive integer.

```rust
::RANGE(start, end)
```

**Example:**

```rust
QUERY GetRange(start: U32, end: U32) =>
    range <- N<User>::RANGE(start, end)
    RETURN range
```
