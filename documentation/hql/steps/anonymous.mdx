### Anonymous Traversal 

Anoymous traversals are used as inner traversals that don't break the overall traversal flow. 
They continue as a 'sub-traversal' starting from the previous step.

```rust
_::<traversal>
```

**Example:**

```rust
QUERY FilterUsers() =>
    users <- N<User>::WHERE(_::In<Follows>::COUNT::GT(100))::Out<Follows>
    RETURN users
```

This query will filter the users by the number of followers they have without breaking the overall traversal flow. 

To clarify, this means that the `_::` starts a new traversal that start from the elements returned by the previous step.
