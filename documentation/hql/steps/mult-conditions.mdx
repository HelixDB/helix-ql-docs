title: "Multiple Filter Conditions"
description: Select elements in your graph based on multiple conditions.
---

In the case where you want to filter by multiple conditions,
instead of writing multiple `WHERE` steps, you can use the `AND` and `OR` operations
to chain the conditions together.

Both `AND` and `OR` take a list of expressions that evaluate to a boolean value.
`AND` and `OR` will return a boolean value themselves.

**`AND`**

```rust
::WHERE(AND(<condition1>, <condition2>))
```

**`OR`**

```rust
::WHERE(OR(<condition1>, <condition2>))
```
