## How do I define schemas in HelixDB?

Define the structure of your graph using HelixQL schema definitions. Every node, edge, and vector automatically includes an implicit `ID` field.

### Node schemas

Define node types and their properties:

```helixql
N::NodeType {
  field1: String,
  field2: U32
}
```

---

### Edge schemas

Define relationships between nodes with properties:

```helixql
E::EdgeType {
  From: NodeType,
  To: NodeType,
  Properties: {
    field1: String,
    field2: U32
  }
}
```

---

### Vector schemas

Define vector types with metadata properties:

```helixql
V::VectorType {
  field1: String
}
```
