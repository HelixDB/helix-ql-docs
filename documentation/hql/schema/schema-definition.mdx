## How do I define schemas in HelixDB?

Define the structure of your graph using HelixQL schema definitions. Every node, edge, and vector automatically includes an implicit `ID` field.

### Node Schema

Defines node types and their properties in the graph.

```rust
N::NodeType {
  field1: String,
  field2: U32
}
```

---

### Edge Schema

Defines relationships between nodes and their properties.

```rust
E::EdgeType {
  From: String,
  To: String,
  Properties: {
    field1: String,
    field2: U32
  }
}
```

### Vector Schema

Defines the vector type.

```rust
V::VectorType {
  field1: String
}
```
