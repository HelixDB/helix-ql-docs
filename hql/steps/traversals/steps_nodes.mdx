### The Idea

HelixQL is strongly typed. That means it stops you traversing edges or accessing properties that don't exist.


## `Out`

Get the nodes connected by outgoing edges of specific type.

```rust
::Out<EdgeType>
```

**Example:**

```rust 
QUERY GetUserFollowing(userID: String) {
    following <- N<User>(userID)::Out<Follows>
    RETURN following
}
```

---

## `In`

Get the nodes connected by incoming edges of specific type.

```rust
::In<EdgeType>
```

**Example:**

```rust 
QUERY GetUserFollowers(userID: String) {
    followers <- N<User>(userID)::In<Follows>
    RETURN followers
}
```

---

## `OutE`

Get the edges connected by outgoing edges of specific type.

```rust
::OutE<EdgeType>
```

**Example:**

```rust 
QUERY GetFollowingDetails(userID: String) {
    following <- N<User>(userID)::OutE<Follows>
    RETURN following
}
```

---

## `InE`

Get the edges connected by incoming edges of specific type.

```rust
::InE<EdgeType>
```

**Example:**

```rust 
QUERY GetFollowersDetails(userID: String) {
    followers <- N<User>(userID)::InE<Follows>
    RETURN followers
}
```
