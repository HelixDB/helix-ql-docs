title: "Conditional Steps"
description: "Filter and conditionally select elements in your graph.
These operations allow you to filter and select specific elements from your graph based on conditions."
---

---

### `WHERE`

Filter elements based on specific conditions.

```rust
::WHERE(<condition>)
```

The condition in the `WHERE` step must evaluate to a boolean value.
If the condition is not met, the element will be filtered out.

**Example:**

```rust
QUERY GetAdultUsers {
    // Filter to only users over 18
    adult_users <- N<User>::WHERE(_::{age}::GT(18))
    RETURN adult_users
}
```

---

## Comparison Operations

The following operations can be used to compare values.
`EQ` and `NEQ` can be used to compare strings, booleans, and numbers.
`GT`, `GTE`, `LT`, and `LTE` can only be used to compare numbers.

**String, Boolean, and Number Operations**
| Operation | Description | Example |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `::EQ(value)` | Equals | `::WHERE(_::{status}::EQ("active"))` |
| `::NEQ(value)` | Not equals | `::WHERE(_::{age}::NEQ(25))` |

**Number Operations**
| Operation | Description | Example |
| -------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `::GT(value)` | Greater than | `::WHERE(_::{age}::GT(25))` |
| `::LT(value)` | Less than | `::WHERE(_::{age}::LT(30))` |
| `::GTE(value)` | Greater than or equal | `::WHERE(_::{rating}::GTE(4.5))` |
| `::LTE(value)` | Less than or equal | `::WHERE(_::{priority}::LTE(2))` |

---

## `EXISTS`

Returns true if a traversal has any results. Otherwise, it returns false.

```rust
EXISTS(<traversal>)
```

**Example:**

```rust
QUERY GetUsersWithFollowers() {
    users <- N<User>::WHERE(EXISTS(_::In<Follows>))
    RETURN users
}
```

---

# Multiple filter conditions

In the case where you want to filter by multiple conditions,
instead of writing multiple `WHERE` steps, you can use the `AND` and `OR` operations
to chain the conditions together.

Both `AND` and `OR` take a list of expressions that evaluate to a boolean value.
`AND` and `OR` will return a boolean value themselves.

**`AND`**

```rust
::WHERE(AND(<condition1>, <condition2>))
```

**`OR`**

```rust
::WHERE(OR(<condition1>, <condition2>))
```
