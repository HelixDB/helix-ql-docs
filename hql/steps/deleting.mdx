### `DROP`

Drops elements from your database. The `DROP` effects the elements returned by the traversal.

```rust
DROP <traversal>
```
You can use the drop on any traversal that returns a list of elements. 
`DROP` will do nothing if the result of the expression is not a list of elements or if the list is empty.

**Example:**

```rust
QUERY DropFollowing(userID: ID) =>
    DROP N<User>(userID)::Out<Follows>
    RETURN NONE
```

This query will drop all of the `Out` nodes of the user.
