## Graph Traversal Fundamentals

Graph traversal is the process of visiting nodes and edges in a graph. Helix QL provides a rich set of operations to navigate your graph data efficiently.

## Selection Operations

These operations serve as starting points for your graph traversals.

### Node Selection (`N`)

Select nodes from your graph to begin traversal.

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `N` | Select all nodes in the graph |
| `N<Type>` | Select all nodes of a specific type |
| `N("id")` | Select a node by its ID |
| `N<Type>("id1", "id2")` | Select nodes of a specific with given IDs and define its type for correctness |

<Accordion title="Example: Node Selection">
```rust
QUERY GetUsers(userID: String) {
    // Select all nodes
    nodes <- N
    
    // Select all User nodes
    users <- N<Users>
    
    // Select a specific User by ID
    user <- N<User>(userID)
    
    // Select multiple Users by IDs
    other_users <- N<Users>(userID, "other_uuid")
    
    RETURN nodes, users, user, other_users
}
```
</Accordion>

### Edge Selection (`E`)

Select edges from your graph to begin traversal.

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `E` | Select all edges in the graph |
| `E<Type>` | Select all edges of a specific type |
| `E("id")` | Select an edge by its ID |
| `E<Type>("id1", "id2")` | Select edges of a specific type with given IDs |

<Accordion title="Example: Edge Selection">
```rust
QUERY GetFollowers(edgeID: String) {
    // Select all edges
    edges <- E
    
    // Select all Follows edges
    specific_edges <- E<Follows>
    
    // Select a specific Follows edge by ID
    follow_edge <- E<Follows>(edgeID)
    
    // Select multiple Follows edges by IDs
    other_edges <- E<Follows>(edgeID, "other_edge_id")
    
    RETURN edges, specific_edges, follow_edge, other_edges
}
```
</Accordion>

### Anonymous Traveral (`_`)

Continue a traversal without breaking the overall traversal flow.

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `_` | Select all nodes/edges you were just traversing |
| `_<Type>` | Select all nodes/edges (from the last step) with a specific type |
| `_("id")` | Filter the last step by ID |
| `_<Type>("id1", "id2")` | Filter the last step by IDs and define its type for correctness |

<Accordion title="Example: Anonymous Traversal">
```rust
QUERY FindActiveUsers() =>
    users <- N<Person>::WHERE(_::{Age}::GT(25))
    withFollowers <- users::WHERE(EXISTS(_::In<Follows>))
    RETURN withFollowers
```
</Accordion>
## Traversal Operations

Once you've selected your starting points, these operations allow you to navigate through the graph.

### Node-to-Node Navigation

Move from nodes to their connected nodes.

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `::Out` | Traverse to nodes connected by outgoing edges |
| `::Out<EdgeType>` | Traverse to nodes connected by outgoing edges of specific type |
| `::In` | Traverse to nodes connected by incoming edges |
| `::In<EdgeType>` | Traverse to nodes connected by incoming edges of specific type |
| `::Both` | Traverse to nodes connected by edges in either direction |
| `::Both<EdgeType>` | Traverse to nodes connected by edges of specific type in either direction |

<Accordion title="Example: Node-to-Node Navigation">
```rust
QUERY GetFriendsAndFollowers(userID: String) {
    // Find user by ID
    user <- N<User>(userID)
    
    // Get users that this user follows (outgoing direction)
    following <- user::Out<Follows>
    
    // Get users that follow this user (incoming direction)
    followers <- user::In<Follows>
    
    // Get all connections in both directions
    connections <- user::Both<Follows>
    
    RETURN following, followers, connections
}
```
</Accordion>

### Node-to-Edge Navigation

Move from nodes to their connected edges.

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `::OutE` | Get outgoing edges from nodes |
| `::OutE<EdgeType>` | Get outgoing edges of specific type |
| `::InE` | Get incoming edges to nodes |
| `::InE<EdgeType>` | Get incoming edges of specific type |
| `::BothE` | Get edges in either direction |
| `::BothE<EdgeType>` | Get edges of specific type in either direction |

<Accordion title="Example: Node-to-Edge Navigation">
```rust
QUERY GetUserRelationships(userID: String) {
    // Find user by ID
    user <- N<User>(userID)
    
    // Get all outgoing relationship edges
    outgoing_relationships <- user::OutE
    
    // Get only outgoing "Follows" edges
    follows_edges <- user::OutE<Follows>
    
    // Get incoming "Follows" edges
    followed_by_edges <- user::InE<Follows>
    
    RETURN outgoing_relationships, follows_edges, followed_by_edges
}
```
</Accordion>

### Edge-to-Node Navigation

Move from edges to their connected nodes.

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `::OutN` | Get source node (where edge starts) |
| `::InN` | Get target node (where edge ends) |
| `::BothV` | Get both source and target nodes |

<Accordion title="Example: Edge-to-Node Navigation">
```rust
QUERY GetFollowRelationshipDetails(relationshipID: String) {
    // Find a specific Follows relationship by ID
    relationship <- E<Follows>(relationshipID)
    
    // Get the user who initiated the follow (source)
    follower <- relationship::OutN
    
    // Get the user being followed (target)
    followed <- relationship::InN
    
    // Get both users InNolved in the relationship
    both_users <- relationship::BothV
    
    RETURN follower, followed, both_users
}
```
</Accordion>

## Combining Traversal Steps

Helix QL allows you to chain traversal operations to create complex graph queries.

<Accordion title="Example: Chained Traversal">
```rust
QUERY GetFriendsOfFriends(userID: String) {
    // Find user by ID
    user <- N<User>(userID)
    
    // Get users that this user follows and then users they follow (friends of friends)
    friends_of_friends <- user::Out<Follows>::Out<Follows>
    
    RETURN friends_of_friends
}
```
</Accordion>
