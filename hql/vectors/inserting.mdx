title: "Inserting Vectors"
---

These operations allow you to insert vectors into Helix.

### `AddN`

Create new nodes in your graph.

```rust
AddV<Type>
AddV<Type>(vector, {properties})
```

**Example:**

In schema.hx:

```rust
V::Document {
    text: String
    created_at: I64
}
```

In query.hx:

```rust
QUERY InsertVector (vector: [F64]) =>
    // Create an empty user node
    basic_user <- AddV<Document>(vector)
    // You could also write it like this with properties
    AddV<Document>(vector, { text: "Hello, world!", created_at: 1713849600 })
    RETURN basic_user
```

**Note:**
Currently, we only support using an array of `F64` values to represent the vector.
We will be adding support for different types such as `F32`, binary vectors and 
more in the very near future. Please reach out to us if you need a different vector type.
