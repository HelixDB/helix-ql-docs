title: "Searching Vectors"
---

These operations allow you to search for vectors in Helix. Searching is done using cosine similarity.

### `SearchV`

Search for vectors in your graph.

```rust
SearchV<Type>(vector, {properties})
```

**Example:**

In schema.hx:

```rust
V::Document {
    text: String
    created_at: I64
}
```

In query.hx:

```rust
QUERY SearchVector (vector: [F64], k: I64) =>
    // Search for the vector in the graph (returns k results)
    documents <- SearchV<Document>(vector, k)
    RETURN documents
```
---
**Note:**
Currently, we only support using an array of `F64` values to represent the vector.
We will be adding support for different types such as `F32`, binary vectors and 
more in the very near future. Please reach out to us if you need a different vector type.

### Prefiltering

You can prefilter the results of a search by adding a `PREFILTER` clause to the query.
The condition in the `PREFILTER` step must evaluate to a boolean value. 

```rust
SearchV<Type>(vector)::PREFILTER(<boolean_expression>)
```

**Example:**

```rust
QUERY SearchVector (vector: [F64], now: I64) =>
    documents <- SearchV<Document>(vector)::PREFILTER(_::{created_at}::LTE(now))
    RETURN documents
```

The condition is applied through out the search process. At each step, when the HNSW algorithm
looks at the nearest neighbors, it will only consider nodes that satisfy the condition. 
This means that the final results have only been influenced by other vectors that satisfy the condition.

---

### Postfiltering

You can postfilter the results of a search by adding a `WHERE` clause to the query.
The condition in the `WHERE` step must evaluate to a boolean value. 

```rust
SearchV<Type>(vector)::WHERE(<boolean_expression>)
```

**Example:**

```rust
QUERY SearchVector (vector: [F64], now: I64) =>
    documents <- SearchV<Document>(vector)
    documents <- documents::WHERE(_::{created_at}::LTE(now))
    RETURN documents
```

The condition is applied after the search has been completed.
