## 1. Property Access

### Accessing Properties

```rust
// Get specific properties
::{Name, Age}
```
Appending the above to the end of a traversal will return an object with the specified properties like so:
```rust
[
    {
        Name: "John",
        Age: 30
    }, 
    ...
]
```
### Accessing the ID

```rust
// Get the ID of the selected element using the standard access
::{id}

// Or use the ID function
::ID
```
### Spread Operator
Using the spread operator, you can include all properties of the selected element in the returned object.

```rust
::{
    userID: id,
    .. // this is the spread operator to include everything else as is
}
```


## 2. Property Addition

```rust
// Add/update properties
::{
    NewField: "value",
    ComputedField: _::Out<Follows>::COUNT
}
```
By defining new properties, you can modify the object returned by the traversal. The above will return an object like so:
```rust
[
    {
        <Other Properties>,
        NewField: "value",
        ComputedField: <Some Number>
    }, 
    ...
]
```

## 3. Property Exclusion
If you want to access all properties except for a few, you can use the exclude operator.
```rust
// Get all properties except for the id and the name
::!{
    id, name
}
```

## 4. Nested Mappings
If you want to access a propertis that traverse from the selected element, you can use the nested variable to continue the traversal.

```rust
// Defines **usr** as a variable that can me used inside the mapping
::|usr|{
            following: usr::In<Follows>,
            posts: posts::{
                postID: ID,
                creatorID: usr::ID,
                .. // this is the spread operator to include everything else as is
            },
        }
```

<Accordion title="Example">
```rust
QUERY findFriends(userID: String) =>
  user <- N<User>(userID)
  posts <- user::Out<Posts>::RANGE(20)
  RETURN user::|usr|{
            ID, name, age, 
            following: usr::In<Follows>,
            posts: posts::{
                postID: ID,
                creatorID: usr::ID,
                ..
            },
        }
```
</Accordion>


## 5. Returning a Range

To return an certain amount of elements, you can use the `RANGE` function.

```rust
// Get the first 10 users
users <- N<User>::RANGE(0, 10)

// Get 10 users starting from the 10th user
users <- N<User>::RANGE(10, 20)
```
